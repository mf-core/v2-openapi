      Provide a billing interval.  Accepted values are:

      * `DAY`
      * `WEEK`
      * `MONTH`
      * `YEAR`
      * `LDOM` (last day of month)
    enum:
      - DAY
      - WEEK
      - MONTH
      - YEAR
      - LDOM
    example: MONTH
  period:
    type: integer
    description: |-
      An interval period represents the number of billing `interval`s 
      that comprise a billing `cycle`.

      For example, if you intend to bill a recurring plan every 2 
      weeks (a billing `cycle`), you would provide `WEEK` as the 
      `interval` value and `2` as the `period` value.

      Likewise, if you intend to bill every month (a billing `cycle`) 
      you would provide `MONTH` as an `interval` value and `1` 
      as the `period` value

      Use a whole number string or interval.  Decimal values are not allowed.
    example: 1
  cycles:
    type: integer
    description: 'Provide the number of billing payment cycles.  For example,  if you intend to create annual plans billed on the last day  of every month for a year (12 months), you would provide `LDOM`  as the `period` value, `1` for the `period` value and `12` as the  `cycles` value'
