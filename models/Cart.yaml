      The `cart.total_amount` is the total amount for all items, taxes, discounts, fees and shipping charges in the cart.

      * A `cart.total_amount` greater than `0` will disable the `cart.total_amount` calculation.
      * If the `cart.total_amount` parameter is omitted or the value is `null` or `0` the `cart.total_amount` will be calculated from the sum of (`cart.items.total` + `cart.fees.total` + `cart.taxes.total`) - `cart.discounts.total`.
    example: 0
